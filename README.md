<center># 🚀 Expo Starter Template</center>

> A clean, modern, and fully prepared **Expo development starter** for building mobile applications faster.

This repository is **not a finished application**.  
It is a **ready-to-use development template** that comes preconfigured with the essential structure, tools, and dependencies so you can immediately focus on building features — not setup.

---

## 🧠 Why This Template?

Starting a new project usually means repeating the same setup steps again and again.

This starter helps you:

- ⚡ Skip boilerplate configuration
- 📦 Get common dependencies preinstalled
- 🧩 Use a clean and scalable structure
- 🛠️ Start coding immediately
- 🧹 Keep your project organized from day one

Clone → Install → Develop ✅

## ✨ What's Included

- 📁 Organized folder structure
- ⚡ Expo-ready configuration
- 🧰 Development scripts

---

## 📍 Entry Point

The main screen of the app starts here:

```
/app/Home.tsx
```

You can begin developing your application by editing this file.
